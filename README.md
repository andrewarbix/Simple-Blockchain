# Simple Blockchain Example in Python

This repository contains an example of a simple cryptocurrency blockchain implemented in Python. It demonstrates the fundamental principles of a blockchain, such as creating blocks, adding new blocks to the chain, and computing hashes.

## Functionality

- **Genesis Block Creation**: the first block in the chain, which has no preceding block.
- **Adding New Blocks**: each new block contains data and the hash of the previous block.
- **Printing the Blockchain**: outputs information about each block.

## Running the Script

To run the script, simply execute:

```bash
python simple_blockchain.py
